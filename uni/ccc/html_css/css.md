Cascading Style Sheets
Used since 1997, A W3C standard for styling HTML, Human readable text files

CSS is a series of rules. You choose a rule to manipulate with a Selector. [[selectors]] have properties, which have values. Multiple selectors can use the same block of attributes(properties). The formatting looks like this:

selector, selector>nested_selector:pseudo-class {
	property: value;
	property2: value2;
}
