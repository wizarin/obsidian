Twisted
	Unshielded Twisted pair (UTP) - cat 3 to 6 defines max cable speeds
		cat 3 - 10Mbps
		cat 4 - 16
		cat 5 - 100
		cat 5e - 1Gbps
		cat 6 - 10 Gbps
	Shielded Twisted Pair (STP) - mostly used by IBM
Coaxial
	Copper core
	Insulator
	Shield
	Insulator
Fibre-optic
	EU core width is 50, US is 62.5
	can have singlemode or multimode cores
	optical interfaces at each end of the cable to modulate.
	Dense wave division multiplexing (DWDM). Up to 25000 simultaneous transmissions
	pros:
		Immune to electrical noise
		Difficult to tap
		lightweight
		small
