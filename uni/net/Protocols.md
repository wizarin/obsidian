A protocol is the "what if" rules for a communication between devices in a network. Protocols work as 'virtual circuits' because they interact in base 2 or hex. The protocol can use up to seven layers. The layers are a certain amount of bits in length with the "data" packet having a limitless payload size in some cases.
Examples of protocols include TCP, IP, HTTPS, UDP, STMP, Ethernet
