**Network**
	A group of two or more devices that are connected through infrastructure (hardware) that can communicate using software protocols.

**Interoperable**
	A network that consists of devices that use different operating systems, aided by protocols to achieve this.

[**Protocol**](protocols)
	A set of rules for the component-to-component communications in a network

[**Topology**](topologies)
	The physical structure of a network.

OSI Model
	Open Systems Interconnection reference model. This is 

Modulation
	The process of encoding digital or analogue information onto a carrier signal for transmission over a medium (wires or wireless). An example is the Physical layer in the OSI, here modulation is used to create a bitstream that can then be transmitted over the cables(or Wi-Fi) in a network and demodulated by components in the network.

MAC Address
	Media Access Control Address. This is a 12-digit hexadecimal number assigned to each device in a network. All MAC addresses are unique to their device.

CSMA/CD
	Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Detection

Multiplexing
	A process that combines multiple data streams into one channel or medium. In the OSI, this is done at the Transport layer.

TTL 
	time to live 

DHCP
     Dynamic 

ARP
     Address Resolution Protocol
