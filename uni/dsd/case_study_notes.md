Requirements

CCH needs a database system that will store at the minimum those core data:

  

- Departments
    
- Staff members
    
- Services
    
- Customers
    
- Car details
    
- Service appointment
    
- Service details
    

There will be additional data that needs to be stored, and the discretion lies with each student to decide what is necessary. These items are the minimum required by the client. Higher grades will be awarded to students who include more extensive and insightful data and details in their databases. Some examples would be:  
  

- Technician availability
    
- Customer feedback
    
- Appointment status
    
- Service reports
    
- Instalments plans.
