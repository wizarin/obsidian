**Wide area networks(WAN)**
Pros and cons
     Unlimited distance- interconnection is done through public carries like ISPs
     High speed but expensive in relation
     Transparent LAN Services (TLS)
     Value added

Switched Public Network Options (WANs)
     Circuit switched
         Anaolg voice
         ISDN
     Virtual circuit switching - Not all WAN tech supports both
         Switched - SVC
             Like dialup
             Older tech like X.25
         Permanent - PVC
             Expensive
             Lease lines
             Frame-relay
        ATM can be either SVC or PVC
        TLS is "best effort"
         
Individual data units can be called:
    Packets
    Datagrams
    Cells
Packets and frames are variable in length
Cells are fixed in length
     They can be processed in hardware, no software processing time
     Much higher data rates due to this
     5-byte header, 48-byte packet


Objectives and services for value-added WANs. (Considerations)
     Provide - a path(route) across the WAN, knowing what routers to take
     Divide - segment and reassemble data when necessary, helps mitigate congestion
     Limit network traffic to control traffic congestion using a signal "Slow down, network congested"
     
X.25 - precursor to IP
     Uses physical, data link and sometimes network layer in OSI model
     Last used in WAN in 2015
         By financial card companies
     Still used by aviation industry due to "ain't broke don't fix"

PAD - Packet Assembler/Dissembler
     Needed for X.25
     Like modem

Frame Relay - Alternative to X.25 
layer 2 protocol defined in 1984 by ITU and ANSI
     Higher performance - needed for applications such as graphics and image transfers
     Supports two level of traffic - CIR, EIR
     How the load is managed in network core, congestion control
     Committed Information Rate
        Guaranteed to go through, traffic up to the rate will go through
     Excess Information Rate
         Packets outside the bandwidth of the network. "Best effort" Packets are 'eligible for discard"

FRADS - Frame Relay A Device
     Labels packets using route identifier(ID)



Pros
     Stable, international standard
     Widely available in most country and providers

Cons
     PVC, little support for SVC
     No fault tolerance, relies on other protocols to manage lost or damaged data
     Not suitable for delay sensisitve data like video calls
     Involves data and processing overheads, increasing time cost

X.25 Vs Frame Relay
     Error handling Vs no error handling
     Slow Vs fast
     Worldwide Vs countries with fibre
     Good for terminal to host Vs LAN to LAN
