**lit review**
Algorithms and their broadest impact on our lives.
Write intro after main article, lay out the topics simply.
Start sentences with this source says X or X says this.
Use stats.
A sentence or two to summarise the outcome of the research in the paragraph. "These issues are being discussed for these reasons, these reasons bring up other things."
Conclusion pulls all arguments together.

Less descriptive, challenge the arguments made in an article by using other articles.

Attenuation - Shannon and nyquis
The noise that can be measured in the signal
The further you are from a signal putput the higher the attenuation. Like a radio signal that gets more white noise as you drive away from it. This is predictable noise that increases as signal gets weaker 

Phase delay/distortion -
A delay added to the signal, the signal is repeated but with a delay so you can interpret it twice 

Frame relay - 

Bandwidth
The max frequency of signal that can go through. Anything outside the bandwidth is deleted from the signal

Noise
General random noise due to physical interference, unpredictable
