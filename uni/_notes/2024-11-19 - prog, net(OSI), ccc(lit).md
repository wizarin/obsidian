While loop is used when the end conditions of the loop are known but not how many tubes the loop might happen.

For loop is when number of iterations is known.

If statement evaluates boolean variables without ==  maybe same for while?

**OSI reference model**
Open Systems Interconnection
Started in 1977, Drafted in 1979, ratified in 1984

International Organisation for Standardisation - ISO researched network schemes to solve issues surrounding communications between devices using different OS
They came up with a reference NETWORK MODEL. Architectural model

A model is a high-level concept (conceptual) view of a complex object

The OSI model provides common terminology
It splits device communication into 7 layers that have specific functions and tasks. 
These layers reduce complexity.
Each layer provides a service the the layer above.
The lower 4 layers are to do with data handling, the flow of data from end to end devices.
The upper 3 are involved with applications and services.
A packet is sent by working from the top down and received by working up.

7. Application layer - user interaction
6. Presentation layer - data representation, this decodes the data to be able to display it on the application layer. Translates between multiple data formats into a common format for the application layer
5. Session - defines how to start and end communication. 
4. Transport - regulates flow(the speed of transmission using TCP), segments and 
3.  Network - routers, IP and ARP, data fragmentation, flow control
2. Data link - Switches and hubs, media, multiple Mac addresses.
1.  Physical - wires. Deals with voltage levels, timing of voltage changes, physical data rates.

Protocols that don't use OSI
     Novell's protocols
     IBMs protocols

These standards define an open system.
Open Systems - A system everyone can use and interact with.
This system offers independence from proprietary.
Open procurement 

Standards are monitored by checking the standards every 5 to 6 years.
Fast tracking new technology developments that require new ratified standards.
