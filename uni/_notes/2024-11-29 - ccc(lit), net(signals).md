Periodic signals Vs non-periodic signals
Networks use periodic signals. These signals are based on these values:
     Amplitude - The strength of the signal.
     Frequency - The rate a signals pattern is repeated per second. Standard for WiFi is 2.4ghz or 5ghz. This means that the signal is repeated 2.4 billion times per second.
     Period - The time it takes to repeat a single instance of the pattern in the signal.
     Bandwidth - F_max - F_min. The width of the frequency bands. Defines how much data can be transferred.
     Attenuation - measured in decibels(dB), A = 10^(dB/20). The difference value between the received and induced signal strength. Lower dB values indicate stronger signals with less attenuation.
