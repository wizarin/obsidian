Architecture - logical design of the system. conceptual logic
Organisation - The processes that build up architecture. Units that build up the 'architectural operation'. Hardware(motherboard etc.)

Function - The processes components engage in
	Data Processing - 
	Data Storage - long term(HDD), short term(RAM)
	Data Movement - I/O, peripherals, communication of components
	Control - the OS, manages the processes between functions 

Structure - The layout of interconnected components. These main components make up the conceptual idea of a computer:
	CPU - Central Processing Unit
	Memory
	I/O - 
	System busess

CPU
	Registers - short memory in CPU, very fast
	ALU - Arithmetic Logic Unit. 'Large' physical circuits for binary processing
	Control Unit - control the operations in a CPU, decodes into binary. e.g. is ALU doing + or -
	Internal bus

**Generations of Computers**
	Vacuum tubes
		In decimal, 'manual' programming of circuits
	Von Neumann Machine(IAS) 1946 - 1952
		3 main parts of computer structure. Main memory, CPU(consisting of ALU and Program control unit) and I/O
	IAS
		40 bit 'words' in binary. control unit reads the 'words' as instructions e.g. add x numbers
