***AOS***
Eventually all code is made into circuits using gates. 
Circuit efficiency - reduce amount of gates.

**Laws and roots**
(ors are +, ands are * ,  )
Common factors for simplification

LAWS
1. Commutative inputs AB = BA 
2. associative A(BC) = (AB)C
     And logic
3. Distributive A(B+C) = AB + AC
4. Morgan's (AB)' = A' + B'

ROOTS(rules)
1. A + 0 = 0
2. A + 1 = 1
3. A * 0 = 0
4. A * 1 = A, any input can be written as A1
5. A + A = A, remove duplicate terms in when adding
6. A * A = A, remove duplicate
7. A + A' = 1
8. A * A' = 0, any AND term containing this is zero too
9. (A')' = A, the two NOTs cancel
10. A + AB = A1 + AB = A(1 + B) = A1 = A
     A + AB = A
11. A + A'B = A + AB + A'B = A + B(A + A') = A + B(1) = A + B
     A + A'B = A + B
     Using r10 to make common terms
12. (A + B)(A + C) = AA + AC + BA + BC = A + AC + BA + BC = A + BA + BC = A + BC

***Programming***
Return ends the function, even in a loop
Return (expression) can return the result of the expression. Any using == returns bool.

Range(start,stop,step)

Outer loop
     Inner loop

**Decision structures** 
 **If statement** 
 <checks an expression> to execute statements. If, else good for binary choices.
 Elif and else at the end to guarantee one branch of if being executed. 
 if char.isdigit(): this is a function that returns a bool so if (bool):

If temp >= 20 && temp < 23:
     return None
If temp < 20:
ElIf 20 <= temp < 23: can remove 20 <= as condition is checked by previous branch of if>

**Boolean expressions**
Comparison operators
Logical operators
     Not and in
Short circuit
     If x and y: 
     if x condition is not met then y is not checked
