    AVG
         Calculates the sum of values in selected attribute(column) and divides by the amount of not NULL values.
    ROUND
         Takes two arguments, the value and the SF it is rounded to.
     
UNION
    Combines the result of two or more SELECT statements, deletes duplicate rows (UNION ALL to avoid this)
    SELECTS must have same number of columns using the same data types
