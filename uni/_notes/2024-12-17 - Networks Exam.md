     OSI reference model 
     CSMA/CD
     Topologies
     Some protocols
         **Connection** oriented - end to end. Setup, hold, clear down. Very good QoS. Delay. Phone
         **Connectionless** - sharing resources, full addressing of packets. No setup, connection, hold, clear down. No delivery acknowledgment. Uses whole network. Post

*Don't need WAN, X25, Frame Relay*

**Protocols**:
    What if rules for network.
    End to end integrity
    TCP
