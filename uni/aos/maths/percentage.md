fraction x 100 = percentage

Two methods to work out a given percentage of a number.
Method 1:
	Write the two numbers as a fraction, simplify the fraction or make the denominator 100.
Method 2:
	Calculate 1% by dividing by 100 and multiply up to required percentage.

Method to calculate the original number after a given percentage has been taken away:
	calculate 1% by setting the reduced number to numerator and the current percentage to denominator. Multiply by 100 to get original number.

Compound interest can be calculated by `starting_number x percentage_increase ... x percentange_increase` where `...` is the instance of percentage increase is repeated by number of years.

To conflate multiple percentages as a total percentage you multiply the fraction out of 100 by the percent that it occupies in the total percentage.
