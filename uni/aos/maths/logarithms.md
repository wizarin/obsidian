Used to find the index when the base and final number is known. $$ log_28 = 3 $$
2 is the base, 8 is the argument, 3 is the power that the base is raised to to equal the argument$$ y = a^x == log_ay = x $$
**Laws of logarithms:**
When adding logarithms with the same base, multiply the arguments $$ log_2x + log_2y = log_2xy $$
When subtracting logarithms with the same base, divide the arguments $$ log_2x - log_2y = log_2\frac{x}y $$
The coefficient of a logarithm can be written as an index of the argument $$ nlog_ax = log_ax^n $$
To change the base of a logarithm divide a log with the desired base and the argument of the original log by a log with the desired base and an argument that is the base of the original log. $$ log_ax = \frac{log_bx}{log_ba} $$
$$ log_2(xy)^2 $$
