*base* raised to the power/index of *index* = base^2

a = any number
$$a^0 = 1$$
$$a^1 = a$$
**Laws of indices:**
Treat all coefficients normally.
When multiplying, add the indices of similar terms	$$a^1 * a^3 = a^4$$
When dividing, subtract the indices of similar terms $$ \frac{a^1}{a^3} = a^{-2} $$
When raising one power to the other, multiply them $$ (a^2)^3 = a^6 $$
Negative indices are equivalent to the reciprocal with a positive index $$ a^{-2} = \frac{1}{a^2} $$
A fractional index is a root of the number, the root is determined by the denominator
