There are finite and infinite sequences. The terms are referred to using subscript notation. $$ x_1, x_2, x_3 ... x_{15} $$
The terms can often be written using a general formula, e.g. $$ x_k = 2k - 1 $$
A recurrence relation is an equation that recursively defines a sequence. Once one or more terms are given, further terms are defined by a function of the preceding terms.
