n = base
n^(range(n-n, n-1))

Decimal = base 10
$$
10^0 = 1,\    
10^1 = 10, \
10^2 = 100, \
... \
10^8 = 100000000
$$
[[binary]] = base 2
$$
2^0 = 1,\ 2^1 = 2,\ 2^2 = 4,\ ...\ 2^8 = 256
$$
$2^{16} = 1024$, which is a megabyte.
[[hex]] = base 16


Decimal to Base:
	Divide number by base and record remainder. The remainders from first to last read the number in the new base. The last remainder is the highest digit of the number in the new base.
